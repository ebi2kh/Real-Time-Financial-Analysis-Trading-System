## Mandatory Trading Indicators

Below is an explanation of the required trading indicators and their significance:

1. **Moving Average (MA)**:

   - The Moving Average is a fundamental indicator used to identify the direction of the trend in a stock's price movement over a specified period. It is computed by averaging the closing prices of a stock over a predetermined number of periods, such as days or hours. By smoothing out short-term price fluctuations, the Moving Average provides insights into the overall trend direction, helping traders identify bullish (uptrend) or bearish (downtrend) market conditions.

2. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:

   - The Exponential Moving Average is a variant of the Moving Average that assigns more weight to recent price data, making it more responsive to current market conditions. Unlike the simple Moving Average, which gives equal weight to all data points, the EMA places greater emphasis on recent price movements, reflecting changes in market sentiment more quickly. This makes the EMA particularly useful for traders seeking to capitalize on short-term price trends or momentum.

3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
   - The Relative Strength Index is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, indicating whether a stock is overbought or oversold. The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 and is calculated based on the ratio of average gains to average losses over a specified period. A high RSI value (typically above 70) suggests that a stock may be overbought and due for a correction, while a low RSI value (usually below 30) indicates oversold conditions, potentially signaling a buying opportunity.

These mandatory trading indicators play a vital role in the decision-making process for traders and investors, providing valuable insights into market dynamics and potential trading opportunities. By incorporating these indicators into the system, users can gain a deeper understanding of stock performance, identify trend reversals or momentum shifts, and make informed decisions regarding buy, sell, or hold actions. Additionally, the availability of these indicators on the system's dashboard enhances usability and empowers users to navigate financial markets with confidence and precision.

    ```
    ./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
    ```

- **Run Data Generation Script (generate.py):**

  - Execute the Python script `generate.py` to generate mock financial data and send it to the Kafka topic.
  - Example command to run the script:
    ```
    python generate.py
    ```

- **Run Ingestion Service (ingestion.py):**

  - Start the Python Flask-based ingestion service `ingestion.py`, which listens for incoming data from the Kafka topic and processes it.
  - Example command to run the service:
    ```
    python ingestion.py
    ```

- **Run Stream Processing Application (Java):**

  - Run the Java-based stream processing application that consumes data from the Kafka topic, performs calculations or analysis, and produces results to another Kafka topic.
  - Use IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE to build and run the stream processing application.
  - Ensure that the Kafka dependencies are correctly configured in your Java project.
  - Start the application within the IDE.

- **Run Trading Signal Service (trading_signal.js):**
